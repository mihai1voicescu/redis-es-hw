HW1:

	What is sharding and why is it used in ES?

	Sharding represents the dividing of an indexâ€™ data volume into smaller parts
called shards. Shards are the building blocks of Elasticsearch and what
facilitate its scalability. Sharding is used in ES due to the fact that it
enables you to distribute data across multiple nodes within a cluster.
